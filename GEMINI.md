## Vitest Mocking Challenges

During the implementation of tasks related to refactoring and adding error handling, significant challenges were encountered with Vitest's mocking capabilities, particularly when dealing with imported modules and their functions.

**Problem:**
When attempting to mock functions imported from utility modules (e.g., `file-utils.mjs` and `llm-api.mjs`) within test files (e.g., `test/classify-inbox.test.mjs` and `test/build-insights.test.mjs`), the mocks did not behave as expected. Errors such as `readdir.mockImplementation is not a function` or `callOpenAI is not defined` were consistently observed.

**Analysis:**
- **Over-mocking/Incorrect Mocking Strategy:** The initial approach involved using `vi.spyOn` on already mocked functions (e.g., `vi.spyOn(readdir, 'mockImplementation')`). This indicates a misunderstanding of how Vitest's `vi.mock` works when combined with `vi.spyOn` for functions that are themselves part of a mocked module.
- **Module Resolution and Hoisting:** Vitest's module mocking can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior due to hoisting or the order of module resolution, especially when mocks are complex or involve nested dependencies.
- **Direct Mocking vs. Spying:** It became apparent that directly mocking the functions (e.g., `readdir.mockImplementation(...)`) within the `vi.mock` factory function for the utility module is the correct approach, rather than trying to `vi.spyOn` them after they have already been mocked.
- **Test Isolation:** The goal of isolating tests was hindered by the complexity of mocking all dependencies, leading to brittle tests that broke easily with minor refactorings in the source code.

**Learnings:**
- **Simpler Mocking is Better:** For utility modules, it's often more effective to provide a simple mock implementation directly within the `vi.mock` factory, rather than trying to `vi.spyOn` individual functions within that mocked module.
- **Focus on Public API:** When testing a module, focus on mocking its direct dependencies and verifying its public API, rather than trying to control every internal function call of its dependencies.
- **Integration Tests for Flow:** For complex interactions between multiple modules, higher-level integration tests that simulate real-world scenarios (without extensive mocking of internal functions) are more valuable.
- **Environment Variables in Tests:** When testing scripts that rely on environment variables (like `OPENAI_API_KEY`), ensure these are properly set within the test environment (e.g., `process.env.VAR_NAME = 'test-value'`) and cleaned up afterwards (`delete process.env.VAR_NAME`).

**Next Steps for Testing:**
- Re-evaluate the testing strategy for `build-insights.mjs` and `classify-inbox.mjs` to simplify mocks and focus on integration-level testing.
- Consider using actual file system operations for tests where appropriate, or a simpler mock file system if needed, to reduce the complexity of mocking individual `fs` functions.
- Prioritize functional correctness and overall system behavior over achieving 100% line/branch coverage through overly complex mocking.

## General Learnings

- **Git Workflow:** The importance of consistently creating new branches for each task, committing changes with clear messages, and merging to `main` after successful completion. This helps maintain a clean and traceable commit history.
- **Error Handling:** The value of adding `try...catch` blocks for robust error handling in file system operations and API calls, ensuring scripts fail gracefully.
- **Centralized Logging:** Implementing a centralized logging utility (`logger.mjs`) improves consistency and simplifies debugging across multiple scripts.
- **Code Refactoring:** Extracting common functionalities into shared utility modules (e.g., `file-utils.mjs`, `llm-api.mjs`) significantly reduces code duplication and improves maintainability.
