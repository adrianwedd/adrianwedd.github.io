# Security Policy

If you discover a vulnerability in this project, please avoid filing public issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report it privately by emailing [security@adrianwedd.com](mailto:security@adrianwedd.com). If you already have a fix, you may open a pull request from a temporary **private** fork instead.

We will coordinate a resolution and disclosure timeline with you.

We will work with you to resolve the issue before any public disclosure.
